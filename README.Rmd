## DT-770 "Panzer" Mod

This is a headphone modification for the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro. The 250 ohm model was used for this mod, but other models should respond well. The mod includes:

* Balanced re-cable and re-wire. Making the headphones fully balanced, duel entry mini XLR to 4 pin XLR.

* Internal sound dampening / audio witchcraft based on [Bill P's mod](https://www.head-fi.org/f/threads/bill-ps-beyerdynamic-dt770-pro-modding-diary-including-sibilance-elimination.707992/).

* Custom paint job and balanced cable.

*NOTE:* The re-cable and sound dampening portions of this mod can be done indipendantly of each other.
